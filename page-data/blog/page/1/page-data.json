It was a great little period of progressively building more complex projects and figuring out how the heck does the web work.</p>\n<h3>A start</h3>\n<p>I'd hope my first job would be as close to coding as possible, but the trend in Trinidad and Tobago was that you'd work a dead end no-coding job for a bit just to get 'work experience' and then get into a tech company where you might be lucky enough to work with some modern frameworks/languages.</p>\n<p>So I was no different, my first job was as an I.T. assistant which really boiled down to putting out fires i.e. troubleshooting people's printers, helping with excel sheets, labelling network cables. It was awful and within a month and a half I started job hunting again and had a few more failed interviews but got an offer with a semi-software company.</p>\n<p>I say semi becuase it was basically a terrible drag and drop proprietary software called <a href=\"https://www.magicsoftware.com/app-development-platform/xpa/\">Magic xpa</a> that they bought that makes the most god-awful software you can read about <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xw287bcTwdZg0fmF9-GduvyWmwmh8cqKIWkfPi4aCK0/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>. I endured it for about 10 months, in which I was able to build a beastly PC to replace my banged up HP Pavilion from 2013.</p>\n<h3>Actual code</h3>\n<p>With time passing by and still not having any full time developer experience I decided I wasted enough time there and starting job hunting once again. I had interviewed with a company that did actual software development with React/Vue/Golang/PHP etc and was really hoping to get an offer from them.</p>\n<p>I also felt like my mental state was taking a toll working on such a lack luster system, that I decided to quit at the end of the month regardless of getting an offer from the company I interviewed at.</p>\n<p>Luck would have it, and I was offered a junior role and from that point on things were incredible.</p>\n<p>They people and environment were amazing, I learnt a ton on how an actual software company runs and all the little processes with scrum, agile etc.</p>\n<p>I had the creative freedom to build and explore different frameworks and ended up touching a bunch of technologies withing web/hybrid mobile/backend APIs.</p>\n<p>It never felt like work for a long long time, until it did. Feeling like work isn't necessarily bad of course. I became more senior in my role and the company also matured. Now we had actual products we wanted to further develop and rollout. I was valued highly in my role and had a bigger say on what we used compared to when I started.</p>\n<p>This coupled with some co-workers leaving left me in a more solo dev position where I maintained multiple frontend apps in different frameworks.</p>\n<p>One co-worker who left later asked me to apply to his company that was based in Germany for a Fullstack position and that the pay was double my current rate.</p>\n<p>We were about the same in terms of skill set so I figured if he made it and thinks I can as well, that I should give it a shot. I mean who would say no to double your salary + work on more global solutions.\nI applied and got promptly rejected and for some reason it stung more than I expected. I felt like I knew enough, but upon further inspection my co-worker friend had a much more robust resume that covered more of the job description than mine did.</p>\n<p>At that point I was slowly losing the interest and drive in my current job because of burn out as well as the rejection meaning thatW what I was currently doing in my day to day just left me with these gaps in my resume that I had no real way of shrinking other than doing side projects outside of work which still wouldn't constitute as 'work experience' either.</p>\n<p>These apps I was working on weren't getting the attention and polish I wanted to give them as my time would be split between them and they were in different frameworks that would require more time to get more advanced in as well.</p>\n<p>Another growing issue was the over-engineering of the overall application architecture which I felt was bogging down our progression each sprint.</p>\n<p>These issues lead me to seriously look elsewhere, for some place that would have more defined roles and responsiblities that also weren't too caught up in complicated architectures. It would have to be remote, because companies like those do not exist in Trinidad and Tobago.</p>\n<p>Getting there however was a whole different story.</p>\n<h3>Remote Work</h3>\n<p>This job hunt was new and very different. indeed.com was my destination and I was so glad to see 10s of jobs that matched my current credentials.</p>\n<p>Within a month of applying, I had a few intro-interviews a bunch of rejections but I felt like I was making some progress.</p>\n<p>The responses to my applications alone was refreshing compared to Trinidad and Tobago where you'd be left wondering if they even saw your email let alone your resume. On some level I was not a complete impostor, and companies were at the least willing to hear me out.</p>\n<p>In that short period of applying/interviewing I realized, though on paper I had some decent experience, I did not have extended experience in particular technologies. I was a bit of 'jack of all trades, master of none' or at least perceived that way.</p>\n<p>I ended up agreeing to work a part-time gig for a start-up, but I was going to quit my job as I figured I could still have some income and on the free time, start hacking away and develop my skillset based on the average junior/medior web developer job requirements.</p>\n<p>The start-up I worked at was so refreshing, it was a big contrast in terms of micro-management, workflow, overall expectations etc.</p>\n<p>I took tickets, I did it, we synced on every Tuesday and I got paid.\nGetting to work on those projects that would not be feasible in Trinidad made it such a cool experience. Though I was part time, I still had a fair say in things and learned a couple of new things, more than I expected to. Also any perceptions I had about myself, notably the impostor syndrome, quickly disintegrated as I made valuable contributions throughout the months that were validated by everyone else there. Most of the work was very simple and I barely had trouble at all.</p>\n<p>I realized juggling those extra responsibilities just makes things harder and contributed to that impostor syndrome I had. Things were lighter and as a result way more fun.</p>\n<p>Fun it was but my overall situation wasn't. My savings was slowly depleting, (TTD that is), not at an alarming rate but definitely noticeable as the weeks went by.\nIt did not help that I practically wasted the first 2 months, barely doing much code than I had originally planned. The reality of my funds depleting really made me feel like a cornered animal and I used that to get my act together.</p>\n<h3>Purgatory</h3>\n<p>From mid Decemeber 2021 to the end of January 2022, I was at it.\nI applied to maybe 200+ jobs on indeed.com alone and maybe 50+ on other job sites and company sites.</p>\n<p>I had few ups and many downs, from intro-interviews, onboarding with remote recruiters, doing code screens (the good and the bad), tons of rejection emails and a few promising leads.</p>\n<p>With each bad outcome, I tried to take it as a learning experience. I realized it was okay to fail, this was my first real attempt in getting a foot in the door for full time remote work. It was going to be a bit painful but I needed to learn and persevere no matter what.</p>\n<p>As things progressed through out the Christmas period to the new year, intro-interviews started being less and less nerve-racking, code screens became less of a boogey-man and I became less doubtful in myself overall.</p>\n<p>I felt like I could taste the job offer somewhere out there. I just needed to continue what I was doing and I'd get that one opportunity.</p>\n<p>Only one I needed. Just one.</p>\n<h3>Out of the wilderness</h3>\n<p>Towards the end of January, I saw an email exhange I had earlier in the month were they asked for my availability to do an intro-interview with some living coding. I had responded and they hadn't gotten back to me since.</p>\n<p>I decided wouldn't hurt to reach out again, worst case, the position was filled or something.\nThey replied and we scheduled to meet.</p>\n<p>Earlier that week I had a final interview with another company and that went super well. It was just to play the waiting game for their verdict. I still planned to meet with the other company regardless of how well things went in that interview.</p>\n<p>So we met and things went super smooth. We arranged to have another meeting after the weekend and that too went well. I had one more interview with them do hash out those HR questions and I was in.</p>\n<p>I WAS IN. I was a bit of a whirlwind, things progressed so quickly (perks of a small company), and I went from waiting on a final yeh/nay from one company to an offer letter from another company within a 4 business days.</p>\n<p>I cancelled any interviews I had scheduled, wrote the first lead I had a heartfelt rejection as best which they responded to in kindness. Now it was just to start the onboarding process at my new company. Exciting times.</p>\n<p>I had done it. New frontiers await me and I couldn't be more stoked to explore it. A fresh start to enjoy and continue to grow and learn as a dev.</p>\n<h4>In the words of Kevin Garnett -</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcz_kDCBTBk\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/Wcz_kDCBTBk/0.jpg\" alt=\"ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE - Kevin Garnett\"></a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Not an easy road","date":"07/02/2022","description":"My dev journey from lowly tech support to rockstar developer.","image":"/img/tilshiloh.jpg","tags":["dev"]},"timeToRead":7}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}},
