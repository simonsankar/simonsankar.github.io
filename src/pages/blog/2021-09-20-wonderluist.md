  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
  specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into

# Markdown Test File
**See the raw source of [TEST.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxstbr/markdown-test-file/master/TEST.md) for the deets!** ([this is the test file rendered](./TEST.md))
This repo contains a markdown file which covers a lot of the syntax. We use it for testing our markdown support.
## Inspiration
The file is based on [the source of John Gruber's Markdown Syntax page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text) ([this is the page rendered](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)) with all the HTML and some more complex stuff removed. (if you want to support the full entirety of Markdown we'd recommend just using the full page instead of this shortened version)
Full credits for that idea go to [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2238012/need-a-sufficiently-long-complex-markdown-document-for-performance-testing).
